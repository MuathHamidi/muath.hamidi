# Applications

Here you can find a collection of web tools I have created.

## Physics Applications

- **[Periodic Table](./apps/periodic_table.html)**: The periodic table and some information about the elements.
- **[VSEPR Calculator](./apps/vsepr_calculator.html)**: A tool to predict the molecular geometry of a molecule based on the VSEPR theory.
- **[Oxidation Number](./apps/oxidation_number.html)**: A tool to assign oxidation numbers to elements in any formula.
- **[Bonds Counter](./apps/bonds_counter.html)**: A tool that takes a CIF file or a folder of CIF files to count the bonds, specifying the participant elements, bond lengths, and the shared mass of elements in crystals.
- **[Crystal Lattice Sites](./apps/crystal_lattice_sites.html)**: A tool that takes a CIF file or a folder of CIF files to return the atomic positions and to plot the primitive cell in 3D.
- **[Interatomic Distances Founder](./apps/interatomic_distances_founder.html)**: A tool to find the interatomic distances distribution.
- **[Interatomic Distances Visualizer](./apps/interatomic_distances_visualizer.html)**: A tool to visualize the interatomic distances distribution.
- **[CIF Maker](./apps/cif_maker.html)**: A tool to create CIF files from input data.
- **[State Basis Convertor](./apps/state_basis_convertor.html)**: A tool to convert the quantum states from the coupled basis to the chemical atomic orbitals basis.

## Utility Applications

- **[Audio Cutter](./apps/audio_cutter.html)**: This tool allows users to precisely trim an uploaded audio file using an interactive waveform editor and export the selected segment as a WAV or MP3 file.
- **[PDF Page Extractor](./apps/pdf_page_extractor.html)**: This tool allows users to select a PDF, specify a page range, convert those pages to high-quality PNG or JPEG images, and download them individually or as a ZIP file.
- **[Image & Text Creator](./apps/image_creator.html)**: This tool allows users to customize an image's size, background, text content, and meta-information, and then generate and manage the resulting image in a gallery.
- **[BibTeX Studio](./apps/BibTeX Studio/index.html)**: This tool instantly parses, cleans, and converts raw BibTeX entries into standardized citation formats (APA, MLA, IEEE, etc.) with real-time previews and exportable LaTeX source code.
