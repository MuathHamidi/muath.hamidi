# Applications

Here you can find a collection of web tools I have created.

- **[Periodic Table](./apps/periodic_table.html)**: The periodic table and some information about the elements.
- **[VSEPR Calculator](./apps/vsepr_calculator.html)**: A tool to predict the molecular geometry of a molecule based on the VSEPR theory.
- **[Oxidation Number](./apps/oxidation_number.html)**: A tool to assign oxidation numbers to elements in any formula.
- **[Bonds Counter](./apps/bonds_counter.html)**: A tool that takes a CIF file or a folder of CIF files to count the bonds, specifying the participant elements, bond lengths, and the shared mass of elements in crystals.
- **[Crystal Lattice Sites](./apps/crystal_lattice_sites.html)**: A tool that takes a CIF file or a folder of CIF files to return the atomic positions and to plot the primitive cell in 3D.
- **[Interatomic Distances](./apps/interatomic_distances.html)**: A tool to plot the interatomic distances distribution.
